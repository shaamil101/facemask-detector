## FaceMaskDetector

FaceMaskDetector is a classifier system using the Deep Learning technique called as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This CNN Model is built using the TensorFlow framework and the OpenCV library which is highly used for real-time applications.
The Face Mask detection model is built using the Sequential API of the keras library. This allows us to create the new layers for our model step by step. The various layers used for our CNN model are described below.

FaceMaskDetector was constructed by Arnav Mardia for Smartnup EdTech.

Structure in repository - "cnn_facemask.png"

# Future Improvements:
1. Currently, the CNN functionality is slow and we would work on increasing the capture speed for real time recognition. 
2. Optimize further for large scale facial recognition
3. Set up frontend web server to connect facial recognition system with a SQL database
